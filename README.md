# Otree-Experiment-on-MEL-tasks
Otree experiment on MEL tasks with 4 different treatments: \
*  Gain-Delay, 
*  Gain-Speedup, 
*  Loss-Delay, and 
*  Loss-Speedup. 
 
 
Created for the "Experimental Economics" M1 class at TSE, given by Chen, Daniel L. in order 
to present the final project "The predictive capabilites of the ITCH-model:  Experimental evidence of model fit with perceived losses"
by Ávila, Antonio; Cosma, Bianca; García, Clara & Hanson, Amund.
